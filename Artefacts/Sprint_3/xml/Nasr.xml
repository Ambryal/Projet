<abstract> MACAON isatoolsuiteforstandardNLPtasks developed for French. MACAON has been de- signed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several na- tive modules for common tasks such as a tok- enization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntac- tic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files. In addition, exchange pro- tocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, dis- tributed under GNU Public License.1 IntroductionThe automatic processing of textual data generated by NLP software, resulting from Machine Transla- tion, Automatic Speech Recognition or Automatic Text Summarization, raises new challenges for lan- guage processing tools. Unlike native texts (texts produced by humans), this new kind of texts is the result of imperfect processors and they are made of several hypotheses, usually weighted with con- fidence measures. Automatic text production sys- tems can produce these weighted hypotheses as n- best lists, word lattices, or confusion networks. It is crucial for this space of ambiguous solutions to be kept for later processing since the ambiguities of the lower levels can sometimes be resolved during high- level processing stages. It is therefore important to be able to represent this ambiguity.âˆ—ThisworkhasbeenfundedbytheFrenchAgenceNationale pour la Recherche, through the projects SEQUOIA (ANR-08- EMER-013) and DECODA (2009-CORD-005-01)MACAON is a suite of tools developped to pro- cess ambiguous input and extend inference of in- put modules within a global scope. It con- sists in several modules that perform classical NLP tasks (tokenization, word recognition, part-of- speech tagging, lemmatization, morphological anal- ysis, partial or full parsing) on either native text or word lattices. MACAON is distributed under GNU public licence and can be downloaded from http://www.macaon.lif.univ-mrs.fr/ .From a general point of view, a MACAON module can be seen as an annotation device1 which adds a new level of annotation to its input that generally de- pends on annotations from preceding modules. The modules communicate through XML files that allow the representation different layers of annotation as well as ambiguities at each layer. Moreover, the ini- tial XML structuring of the processed files (logical structuring of a document, information from the Au- tomatic Speech Recognition module ...) remains untouched by the processing stages.As already mentioned, one of the main charac- teristics of MACAON is the ability for each module to accept ambiguous inputs and produce ambiguous outputs, in such a way that ambiguities can be re- solved at a later stage of processing. The compact representationofambiguousstructuresisattheheart of the MACAON exchange format, described in sec- tion 2. Furthermore every module can weight the solutions it produces. such weights can be used to rank solutions or limit their number for later stages1Annotation must be taken here in a general sense which in- cludes tagging, segmentation or the construction of more com- plex objets as syntagmatic or dependencies trees. </abstract>
