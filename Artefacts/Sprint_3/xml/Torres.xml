INTRODUCTIONT EXTcomplesummarizationx and controveersialvaluationissuehasinalwcomputationalays been a linguistics. In the last decade, significant advances have beenmade in this field as well as various evaluation measures have been designed. Two evaluation campaigns have been led by the U.S. agence DARPA. The first one, SUMMAC, ran from 1996 to 1998 under the auspices of the Tipster program [1], and the second one, entitled DUC (Document Understanding Conference) [2], was the main evaluation forum from 2000 until 2007. Nowadays, the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) [3] provides a forum for assessment of different information access technologies including text summarization.Evaluation in text summarization can be extrinsic or intrinsic [4]. In an extrinsic evaluation, the summaries are assessed in the context of an specific task carried out by a human or a machine. In an intrinsic evaluation, the summaries are evaluated in reference to some ideal model. SUMMAC was mainly extrinsic while DUC and TAC followed an intrinsic evaluation paradigm. In an intrinsic evaluation, anManuscript received June 8, 2010.

DUC used an interface called SEE to allow human judges to compare a peer with a model. Thus, judges give a COVERAGE score to each peer produced by a system and the final system COVERAGE score is the average of the COVERAGE’s scores asigned. These system’s COVERAGE scores can then be used to rank summarization systems. In the case of query-focused summarization (e.g. when the summary should answer a question or series of questions) a RESPONSIVENESS score is also assigned to each summary, which indicates how responsive the summary is to the question(s).Because manual comparison of peer summaries with model summaries is an arduous and costly process, a body of research has been produced in the last decade on automatic content-based evaluation procedures. Early studies used text similarity measures such as cosine similarity (with or without weighting schema) to compare peer and model summaries [5]. Various vocabulary overlap measures such as n-grams overlap or longest common subsequence between peer and model have also been proposed [6], [7]. The BLEU machine translation evaluation measure [8] has also been tested in summarization [9]. The DUC conferences adopted the ROUGE package for content-based evaluation [10]. ROUGE implements a series of recall measures based on n-gram co-occurrence between a peer summary and a set of model summaries. These measures are used to produce systems’ rank. It has been shown that system rankings, produced by some ROUGE measures (e.g., ROUGE-2, which uses 2-grams), have a correlation with rankings produced using COVERAGE.In recent years the PYRAMIDS evaluation method [11] has been introduced. It is based on the distribution of “content” of a set of model summaries. Summary Content Units (SCUs) are first identified in the model summaries, then each SCU receives a weight which is the number of models containing or expressing the same unit. Peer SCUs are identified in the peer, matched against model SCUs, and weighted accordingly. The PYRAMIDS score given to a peer is the ratio of the sum of the weights of its units and the sum of the weights of the best possible ideal summary with the same number of SCUs as the peer. The PYRAMIDS scores can be also used for ranking summarization systems. [11] showed that PYRAMIDS scores produced reliable system rankings when multiple (4 or more) models were used and that PYRAMIDS rankings correlate with rankings produced by ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU2 (i.e. ROUGE with skip 2-grams). However, this method requires the creationof models and the identification, matching, and weighting of SCUs in both: models and peers.[12] evaluated the effectiveness of the Jensen-Shannon (JS ) [13] theoretic measure in predicting systems ranks in two summarization tasks: query-focused and update summarization. They have shown that ranks produced by PYRAMIDS and those produced by JS measure correlate. However, they did not investigate the effect of the measure in summarization tasks such as generic multi-document summarization (DUC 2004 Task 2), biographical summarization (DUC 2004 Task 5), opinion summarization (TAC 2008 OS), and summarization in languages other than English.In this paper we present a series of experiments aimed at a better understanding of the value of the JS divergence for ranking summarization systems. We have carried out experimentation with the proposed measure and we have verified that in certain tasks (such as those studied by [12]) there is a strong correlation among PYRAMIDS, RESPONSIVENESS and the JS divergence, but as we will show in this paper, there are datasets in which the correlation is not so strong. We also present experiments in Spanish and French showing positive correlation between the JS and ROUGE which is the de facto evaluation measure used in evaluation of non-English summarization. To the best of our knowledge this is the more extensive set of experiments interpreting the value of evaluation without human models.The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: First in Section II we introduce related work in the area of content-based evaluation identifying the departing point for our inquiry; then in Section III we explain the methodology adopted in our work and the tools and resources used for experimentation. In Section IV we present the experiments carried out together with the results. Section V discusses the results and Section VI concludes the paper and identifiesfuturework.II. RELATED WORKOne of the first works to use content-based measures in text summarization evaluation is due to [5], who presented an evaluation framework to compare rankings of summarization systems produced by recall and cosine-based measures. They showed that there was weak correlation among rankings produced by recall, but that content-based measures produce rankings which were strongly correlated. This put forward the idea of using directly the full document for comparison purposes in text summarization evaluation. [6] presented a set of evaluation measures based on the notion of vocabulary overlap including n-gram overlap, cosine similarity, and longest common subsequence, and they applied them to multi-document summarization in English and Chinese. However, they did not evaluate the performance of the measures in different summarization tasks. [7] also compared various evaluation measures based on vocabulary overlap. Although these measures were able to separate random fromnon-random systems, no clear conclusion was reached on the value of each of the studied measures.Nowadays, a widespread summarization evaluation framework is ROUGE [14], which offers a set of statistics that compare peer summaries with models. It counts co-occurrences of n-grams in peer and models to derive a score. There are several statistics depending on the used n-grams and the text processing applied to the input texts (e.g., lemmatization, stop-word removal).[15] proposed a method of evaluation based on the use of “distances” or divergences between two probability distributions (the distribution of units in the automatic summary and the distribution of units in the model summary). They studied two different Information Theoretic measures of divergence: the Kullback-Leibler (KL) [16] and Jensen-Shannon (JS ) [13] divergences. KL computes the divergence between probability distributions P and Q in the following way:1 X PwDKL (P jjQ) = 2 Pw log2 Qw (1)wWhile JS divergence is defined as follows:DJS (P jjQ) = 1 X Pw log2 w2+PwQw + Qw log + Q2Qw2 P 2 Pw w w (2)These measures can be applied to the distribution of units in system summaries P and reference summaries Q. The value obtained may be used as a score for the system summary. The method has been tested by [15] over the DUC 2002 corpus for single and multi-document summarization tasks showing good correlation among divergence measures and both coverage and ROUGE rankings.[12] went even further and, as in [5], they proposed to compare directly the distribution of words in full documents with the distribution of words in automatic summaries to derive a content-based evaluation measure. They found a high correlation between rankings produced using models and rankings produced without models. This last work is the departing point for our inquiry into the value of measures that do not rely on human models.III. METHODOLOGYThe followed methodology in this paper mirrors the one adopted in past work (e.g. [5], [7], [12]). Given a particular summarization task T, p data points to be summarizedp 1with input material fIigi=0 (e.g. document(s), question(s), topic(s)), s peer summaries fSUMi;k gsk =01 for input i, andm model summaries fMODELi;j gm 1 for input i, we willj=0compare rankings of the s peer summaries produced by various evaluation measures. Some measures that we use compare summaries with n of the m models:MEASUREM (SUMi;k ;fMODELi;j gn 1) (3)j=0while other measures compare peers with all or some of the input material:MEASUREM (SUMi;k ;Ii0) (4)where Ii0 is some subset of input Ii. The values produced by the measures for each summary SUMi;k are averaged for each system k = 0;:::;s   1 and these averages are used to produce a ranking. Rankings are then compared using Spearman Rank correlation [17] which is used to measure the degree of association between two variables whose values are used to rank objects. We have chosen to use this correlation to compare directly results to those presented in [12]. Computation of correlations is done using the Statistics-RankCorrelation-0.12 package1, which computes the rank correlation between two vectors. We also verified the good conformity of the results with the correlation test of Kendall  calculated with the statistical software R. The two nonparametric tests of Spearman and Kendall do not really stand out as the treatment of ex-æquo. The good correspondence between the two tests shows that they do not introduce bias in our analysis. Subsequently will mention only the of Sperman more widely used in this field.A. ToolsWe carry out experimentation using a new summarization evaluation framework: FRESA –FRamework for Evaluating Summaries Automatically–, which includes document-based summary evaluation measures based on probabilities distribution2. As in the ROUGE package, FRESA supports different n-grams and skip n-grams probability distributions. The FRESA environment can be used in the evaluation of summaries in English, French, Spanish and Catalan, and it integrates filtering and lemmatization in the treatment of summaries and documents. It is developed in Perl and will be made publicly available. We also use the ROUGE package [10] to compute various ROUGE statistics in new datasets.B. Summarization Tasks and Data SetsWe have conducted our experimentation with the following summarization tasks and data sets:1) Generic multi-document-summarization in English (production of a short summary of a cluster of related documents) using data from DUC’043, task 2: 50 clusters, 10 documents each – 294,636 words.2) Focused-based summarization in English (production of a short focused multi-document summary focused on the question “who is X?”, where X is a person’s name) using data from the DUC’04 task 5: 50 clusters, 10 documents each plus a target person name – 284,440 words.1http://search.cpan.org/gene/Statistics-RankCorrelation-0.12/2FRESA is available at: http://lia.univavignon.fr/fileadmin/axes/TALNE/ Ressources.html3http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/2004.html3) Update-summarization task that consists of creating a summary out of a cluster of documents and a topic. Two sub-tasks are considered here: A) an initial summary has to be produced based on an initial set of documents and topic; B) an update summary has to be produced from a different (but related) cluster assuming documents used in A) are known. The English TAC’08 Update Summarization dataset is used, which consists of 48 topics with 20 documents each – 36,911 words.4) Opinion summarization where systems have to analyze a set of blog articles and summarize the opinions about a target in the articles. The TAC’08 Opinion Summarization in English4 data set (taken from the Blogs06 Text Collection) is used: 25 clusters and targets (i.e., target entity and questions) were used – 1,167,735 words.5) Generic single-document summarization in Spanish using the Medicina Cl´ınica5 corpus, which is composedof 50 medical articles in Spanish, each one with its corresponding author abstract – 124,929 words. 6) Generic single document summarization in French using the “Canadien French Sociological Articles” corpus from the journal Perspectives interdisciplinaires sur le travail et la sante´ (PISTES)6. It contains 50 sociological articles in French, each one with its corresponding author abstract – 381,039 words. 7) Generic multi-document-summarization in French using data from the RPM27 corpus [18], 20 different themesconsisting of 10 articles and 4 abstracts by reference thematic – 185,223 words.For experimentation in the TAC and the DUC datasets we use directly the peer summaries produced by systems participating in the evaluations. For experimentation in Spanish and French (single and multi-document summarization) we have created summaries at a similar ratio to those of reference using the following systems:– ENERTEX [19], a summarizer based on a theory of textual energy;– CORTEX [20], a single-document sentence extraction system for Spanish and French that combines various statistical measures of relevance (angle between sentence and topic, various Hamming weights for sentences, etc.) and applies an optimal decision algorithm for sentence selection;– SUMMTERM[21], a terminology-based summarizer that is used for summarization of medical articles and uses specialized terminology for scoring and ranking sentences;– REG [22], summarization system based on an greedy algorithm;4http://www.nist.gov/tac/data/index.html 5http://www.elsevier.es/revistas/ctl servlet? f=7032&revistaid=2 6http://www.pistes.uqam.ca/ 7http://www-labs.sinequa.com/rpm2– J S summarizer, a summarization system that scores and ranks sentences according to their Jensen-Shannon divergence to the source document;– a lead-based summarization system that selects the lead sentences of the document;– a random-based summarization system that selects sentences at random;– Open Text Summarizer[23], a multi-lingual summarizer based on the frequency and– commercial systems: Word, SSSummarizer8, Pertinence9 and Copernic10.C. Evaluation MeasuresThe following measures derived from human assessment of the content of the summaries are used in our experiments:– COVERAGE is understood as the degree to which one peer summary conveys the same information as a model summary [2]. COVERAGE was used in DUC evaluations. This measure is used as indicated in equation 3 using human references or models.– RESPONSIVENESS ranks summaries in a 5-point scale indicating how well the summary satisfied a given information need [2]. It is used in focused-based summarization tasks. This measure is used as indicated in equation 4 since a human judges the summary with respect to a given input “user need” (e.g., a question). RESPONSIVENESS was used in DUC and TAC evaluations.– PYRAMIDS [11] is a content assessment measure which compares content units in a peer summary to weighted content units in a set of model summaries. This measure is used as indicated in equation 3 using human references or models. PYRAMIDS is the adopted metric for content-based evaluation in the TAC evaluations.For DUC and TAC datasets the values of these measures are available and we used them directly. We used the following automatic evaluation measures in our experiments:– ROUGE [14], which is a recall metric that takes into account n-grams as units of content for comparing peer and model summaries. The ROUGE formula specified in[10] is as follows:ROUGE-n(R;M) =Pm 2 M Pn gramP2P countmatch(n   gram)P (5)m 2 M count(n-gram)where R is the summary to be evaluated, M is the set of model (human) summaries, countmatch is the number of common n-grams in m and P , and count is the number of n-grams in the model summaries. For the experiments8http://www.kryltech.com/summarizer.htm 9http://www.pertinence.net 10http://www.copernic.com/en/products/summarizerpresented here we used uni-grams, 2-grams, and the skip 2-grams with maximum skip distance of 4 (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4). ROUGE is used to compare a peer summary to a set of model summaries in our framework (as indicated in equation 3).– Jensen-Shannon divergence formula given in Equation 2 is implemented in our FRESA package with the following specification (Equation 6) for the probability distribution of words w.CTPw = w( NCNwS if w 2 SQw = CT + S (6)w otherwiseN + BWhere P is the probability distribution of words w in text T and Q is the probability distribution of words w in summary S; N is the number of words in text and summary N = NT + NS, B = 1:5jVj, CwT is the number of words in the text and CS is the number of words inwthe summary. For smoothing the summary’s probabilities we have used = 0:005. We have also implemented other smoothing approaches (e.g. Good-Turing [24], that uses the CPAN Perl’s Statistics-Smoothing-SGT-2.1.2 package11) in FRESA, but we do not use them in the experiments reported here. Following the ROUGE approach, in addition to word uni-grams we use 2-grams and skip n-grams computing divergences such as JS (using uni-grams) JS 2 (using 2-grams), JS 4 (using the skip n-grams of ROUGE-SU4), and JS M which is an average of the JS i. JS s measures are used to compare a peer summary to its source document(s) in our framework (as indicated in equation 4). In the case of summarization of multiple documents, these are concatenated (in the given input order) to form a single input from which probabilities are computed.IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTSWe first replicated the experiments presented in [12] to verify that our implementation of JS produced correlation results compatible with that work. We used the TAC’08 Update Summarization data set and computed JS and ROUGE measures for each peer summary. We produced two system rankings (one for each measure), which were compared to rankings produced using the manual PYRAMIDS and RESPONSIVENESS scores. Spearman correlations were computed among the different rankings. The results are presented in Table I. These results confirm a high correlation among PYRAMIDS, RESPONSIVENESS and JS . We also verified high correlation between JS and ROUGE-2 (0:83 Spearman correlation, not shown in the table) in this task and dataset.Then, we experimented with data from DUC’04, TAC’08 Opinion Summarization pilot task as well as single and11http://search.cpan.org/bjoernw/Statistics-Smoothing-SGT-2.1.2/ </abstract>
